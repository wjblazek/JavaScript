<h2> This page demonstrates the bubbling of alerts from a nested element to it's ancestor elements.</h2>
<br><br>

<h4> The alert in this 1st example does not bubble up. <br>
Clicking on the inner most element alerts on it but the alert does not bubble up because <br>there are no alerts in the parent elements.
</h4>
<form>This is the top level FORM with no alert onclicking and no bubbling.
  <div>This is a nested DIV with no alert onclicking and no bubbling.
    <p onclick="alert('This is a leaf p')">This is a nested Paragraph.  Click here to demo bubbling.</p>
  </div>
</form>
<br><br>

<h4> The alert in this example bubbles up 1 level.  <br>
Clicking on the inner most element alerts on it, which bubbles up to it's parent element but no further. <br>
Clicking on the middle element also alerts but does NOT bubble up to the top element.
</h4>
<form>This is the top level FORM with no alert onclicking.
  <div onclick="alert('This is a nested div')">This is a nested DIV. Click here to alert but it does not bubble up. <br>

    <p onclick="alert('This is a leaf p')">This is a nested Paragraph.  Click here to demo bubbling.</p>
  </div>
</form>
<br><br>

<h4> The alert in this example bubbles up to the top level. <br>
Clicking on the inner most element alerts on it, which bubbles up to it's parent element and then to the top element. <br>
Clicking on the middle element also alerts and bubbles up to the top element. <br>
Clicking on the top element alerts on that element only.
